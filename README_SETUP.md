## Common Setup of a generic DB with privileged user

First modifiy "export" variables to your needs:
````
export USER='sqlstudent'
export PASS='sqlstudentpassw'
export HOST='%'
export DB='sqlstudentdb'

sudo mysql -u root -e "\
CREATE USER ${USER}@'${HOST}' IDENTIFIED BY '${PASS}';\
CREATE DATABASE ${DB} CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;\
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ${DB}.* TO ${USER}@'${HOST}';"
````

## Troubleshooting:

````
sudo mysql -u root
use mysql;

flush privileges;
exit;
````
